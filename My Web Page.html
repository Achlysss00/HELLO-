<p>  Create a simple website using html with the following content.  </p>

<h3> 5 things i remember during my childhood  </h3>

<p> 1. I used to tease my playmates for being small and now im the smallest.  </p>
<p> 2. Every time we visit the cemetery, i would sneak some candles on the way home and roll it into a ball.  </p>
<p> 3. I was the one who thought my friends to ride a bike.  </p>
<p> 4. I broke one of my playmates toy and never told him about it.  </p>
<p> 5. I hit a nosy neighbor's kid in the head for messing with me while i was minding my own business.  </p>

<h3> Who will I be After 5 years?  </h3>

<p>  Frankly speaking I'm not quite sure myself, right now, I'm just going with wherever this path i am on takes me. Hopefully it's a place where i will truly love, it doesn't have to be easy, it just needs to be a place where it motivates me to strive harder. I can only hope for the best right now, perhaps my current lifestyle is to blame as to why i dont have a concrete plan for the future, but i regret nothing because i am genuinely happy right now and i wish that my future self is too. </p>
